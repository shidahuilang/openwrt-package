## Instructions

**Regarding Installation:**

The plugin requires dependencies on iputils-arping + curl + jq + bash. For routers with limited memory, please consider the installation carefully. **Before installing, please run the opkg update command to install dependencies during the installation process.**

Developed based on X86 OpenWrt v23.05.0, different systems and devices may encounter various issues. **If you encounter errors in temperature information retrieval, display errors, or other issues, please adapt accordingly.**

**Regarding Hostnames:**

For devices that do not declare hostnames, devices connected via optical modem dial-up, OpenWrt used as a bypass gateway, and other scenarios where hostname retrieval fails, you can set the hostname using the following methods:

- Use device name remarks.
- Configure to obtain the hostname from the optical modem in advanced settings.
- Enable MAC device database.


**Regarding Device Online Status:**

By default, ping/arping is used to actively detect device online status to counter Wi-Fi sleep mechanism. Active detection takes more time but provides more accurate device online status.

- If devices frequently go into sleep mode, please adjust the timeout settings in advanced settings.
- If you don't require highly precise device online information and only need other features, you can disable active detection in advanced settings.


**Regarding Traffic Statistics:**

Traffic statistics functionality depends on `wrtbwmon`. Please install or compile it yourself. **Enabling this plugin will conflict with Routing/NAT, Flow Offloading, proxy internet access, and other plugins, resulting in the inability to obtain traffic statistics. Please choose accordingly.**


**Regarding Bug Submissions:**

When submitting a bug, please provide the following information if possible:

- Device information and plugin version number.
- Prompt information after executing `/usr/share/wechatpush/wechatpush`.
- Log information and file information in the `/tmp/wechatpush/` directory after encountering an error.
- Detailed execution information of `bash -x /usr/share/wechatpush/wechatpush t1`.
