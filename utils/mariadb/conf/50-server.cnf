# * InnoDB
#
# InnoDB is enabled by default with a 10MB datafile in /var/lib/mysql/.
# Read the manual for more InnoDB related options. There are many!

#
# * Security Features
#
# Read the manual, too, if you want chroot!
# chroot = /var/lib/mysql/
#
# For generating SSL certificates you can use for example the GUI tool "tinyca".
#
# ssl-ca=/etc/mysql/cacert.pem
# ssl-cert=/etc/mysql/server-cert.pem
# ssl-key=/etc/mysql/server-key.pem
#
# Accept only connections using the latest and most secure TLS protocol version.
# ..when MariaDB is compiled with OpenSSL:
# ssl-cipher=TLSv1.2

#
# * Character sets
#
# MySQL/MariaDB default is Latin1, but in OpenWrt we rather default to the full
# utf8 4-byte character set. See also client.cnf
#
# Note: In OpenWrt until mariadb 10.2.19-2 the baked-in defaults were
# "DEFAULT_CHARSET=utf8" and "DEFAULT_COLLATION=utf8_general_ci". As MariaDB's
# utf8 (supports three bytes per character) is not really UTF-8 (which needs up
# to four bytes per character) this was changed. Now the baked in-defaults are
# the upstream defaults (Latin1), but in the default configuration (like in the
# file you are currently reading) utf8mb4 is set, which is real UTF-8.
#
# Of course you are free to change this, either here or in a configuration file
# of your own which is read after this .cnf file, see my.cnf in parent folder
# (files are read in alphabetical order).
character-set-server  = utf8mb4
collation-server      = utf8mb4_general_ci

#
# * Unix socket authentication plugin is built-in
#
# Needed so the root database user can authenticate without a password but
# only when running as the unix root user.
#
# Also available for other users if required.
# See https://mariadb.com/kb/en/unix_socket-authentication-plugin/
