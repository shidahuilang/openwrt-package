			The luac "shell" is a precompiled lua chunk, so interactive
			editing and testing of scripts is not possible. However,
			haserl can be compiled with luac support only, and this
			allows lua support even in a small memory environment. All
			haserl lua features listed above are still available. (If
			luac is the only shell built into haserl, the
			haserl.loadfile is disabled, as the haserl parser is not
			compiled in.)
