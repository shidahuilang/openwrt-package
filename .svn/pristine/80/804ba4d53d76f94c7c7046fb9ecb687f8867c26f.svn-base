# Network UPS Tools - hosts.conf
#
# This file does double duty - it lists the systems that multimon will
# monitor, and also specifies the systems that upsstats is allowed to
# watch.  It keeps people from feeding random addresses to upsstats,
# among other things.  upsimage also uses this file to know who it
# may speak to. upsfstats too.
#
# Usage: list systems running upsd that you want to monitor
#
# MONITOR <address> "<host description>"
#
# Please note, MONITOR must start in column 1 (no spaces permitted)
#
# Example:
# MONITOR 10.64.1.1 "Finance department"
# MONITOR 10.78.1.1 "Sierra High School data room #1"
#
MONITOR 127.0.0.1 "Local Host"
