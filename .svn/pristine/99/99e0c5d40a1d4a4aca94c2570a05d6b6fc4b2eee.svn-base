Subject: [PATCH] [core] 101 upgrade fails if Content-Length incl (fixes #3063)

(thx daimh)

commit 903024d7 in lighttpd 1.4.57 fixed issue #3046 but in the process
broke HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols which included Content-Length: 0
in the response headers.  Content-Length response header is permitted
by the RFCs, but not necessary with HTTP status 101 Switching Protocols.

x-ref:
  "websocket proxy fails if 101 Switching Protocols from backend includes Content-Length"
