test_WAN_dual-isolate__piece_of_cake.qos (Cero3 Shaper)

Abstract:
This is a one band cake and ipv6 enabled shaping script for Ethernet gateways. 
This exists for the purpose of testing cake's different isolation options, 
specifically the directional dual-[src|dst]host feature that promises to finally 
tackle the bit-torrent hole in simple.qos. 
This specific version is supposed to be used on WAN interfaces: 
 the script's ingress direction equals the internet/WAN download direction 
 the script's egress direction equals the internet/WAN upload direction
