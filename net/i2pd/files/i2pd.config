config i2pd
	# Make sure your directories have the right owner! (i2pd:i2pd)

	# Set where i2pd should store its data (netDB, certificates, addresses,
	# etc). By default we store it in RAM so no data is written to ROM.
	# If you store data permanently, you may want to enable
	# 'profiles = true' and 'addressbook = true' in i2pd.conf.
	#### IMPORTANT! ####
	# Data is consistently rewritten. DO NOT POINT IT TO INNER ROM. Flash
	# will die.
	option data_dir '/var/lib/i2pd'

	# If you don't store i2pd data permanently, you can still choose to
	# store only addressbooks. If not, i2pd will be forced to do HTTP
	# reseeding on every start. Storing addressbook may be useful
	# if HTTP reseeding is not possible or blocked (by censorship).
	# Even addressbook doesn't take up too much space, extroot is still
	# strongly recommended to avoid flash wear-out.
	# Enable 'addressbook = true' in i2pd.conf to make it take effect.
	#option addressbook_dir '/etc/i2pd/addressbook'
