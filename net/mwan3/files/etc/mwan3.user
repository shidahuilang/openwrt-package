#      <ifup>         Is called by netifd and mwan3track.
#      <ifdown>       Is called by netifd and mwan3track.
#      <connected>    Is only called by mwan3track if tracking was successful.
#      <disconnected> Is only called by mwan3track if tracking has failed.
# $INTERFACE	Name of the interface an action relates to (e.g. "wan" or "wwan").
# $DEVICE	Physical device name of the interface the action relates to (e.g. "eth0" or "wwan0").
#               Note: On an ifdown event, $DEVICE is not available, use $INTERFACE instead.
