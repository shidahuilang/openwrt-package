			SSL allows sessions between upsd and clients to be encrypted and can
			also be used to authenticate servers. This means that stealing port
			3493 from upsd will no longer net you interesting passwords. SSL is
			available via OpenSSL on OpenWRT (NSS doesn't seem to work). If you
			are happy with using passwords to authenticate clients, you can save
			some space and build NUT without SSL support.
