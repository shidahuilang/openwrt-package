		Iputils previously generated separate "ping" and "ping6"
		binaries for supporting IPv4 and IPv6 communication,
		respectively.  Recent versions of iputils have merged
		support for both address families into a single program.
		Select this option to install "ping6" and "ping4" symlinks
		to the unified binary to support compatibility with
		existing tools that may still expect to find the old
		names.
