		Iputils previously generated separate "tracepath" and
		"tracepath6" binaries for supporting IPv4 and IPv6
		communication, respectively.  Recent versions of iputils
		have merged support for both address families into a
		single tracepath program.  Select this option to install
		"tracepath6" and "tracepath4" symlinks to the unified
		binary to support compatibility with existing tools that
		may still expect to find the old names.
