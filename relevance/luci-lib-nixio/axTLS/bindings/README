===============================================================================

The tools to generate the various language bindings are done here.
SWIG 1.3.24 or better is required for creating the Java and Perl bindings.

Perl scripts are used to parse ssl.h and automagically give the appropriate 
bindings.

At present, the four languages supported are:

* C#
* VB.NET
* Java
* Perl

To generate each binding run the following:

C#:
> generate_interface.pl -csharp

VB.NET:
> generate_interface.pl -vbnet


Java:
> generate_SWIG_interface.pl -java
> cd java; swig -java -package axTLSj -noextern axTLSj.i

Perl:
> generate_SWIG_interface.pl -perl
> cd perl; swig -noextern -perl axTLSp.i

Java and Perl both create a library each called libaxtlsj.so and libaxtlsp.so 
(or axtlsj.dll and atlsp.dll on Win32 platforms).

Note: the "-noextern" is deprecated in swig 1.3.27 and newer. The "-noextern"
option was required to get Win32 bindings to work (which is why is has probably
been deprecated).

Each binding (except for Perl) has an extra helper interface to make life 
easier.
