2009-06-26 Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>
	* Fix #518

2009-02-27 Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>
	* Fix #488 and #493 (arp_get() in firewall.c couldn't parse lowercase mac's from /proc/net/arp) with patch from	jch@pps.jussieu.fr.  Otherwise wifidog wouldn't work with recent openwrt and Ubuntu.
	* Fix #525
	
2008-09-30 Wichert Akkerman <wichert@wiggy.net>
	* Add exitcode to iptables failure errors.
	* Include the gw_id in auth server updates so the client does not have
	  to keep track of it in a session.
	* Include the gateway id in the firewall table names. Fixes ticket #466
	* URL encode the token before transmitting (it was already decoded).
	  Fixes ticket #473
	* Clean up compiler warnings.
	* Security: strncpy may not NUL-terminate strings, so enforce this
	  ourselves. Fixes ticket #464
	* Make it possible to protect the status page. Fixes ticket #463.

2008-07-20 Alexandre Carmel-Veilleux <acv@miniguru.ca>
	* src/util.c: Fixed #include bug that caused segfaults on newer Linux

2008-04-21 Alexandre Carmel-Veilleux <acv@miniguru.ca>
	* Integrated patch #452 from Wichert Akkerman <wichert@wiggy.net>: Add const to function arguments in libhttpd to enforce more type checking and prevent certain class of problems.
	* Compatiblity fix: Libhttpd assumes that type u_int is defined. Added an #ifndef/#include <sys/types.h> pair to httpd.h to make sure that assertion is true.
	* Integrated patch #453 from Wichert Akkerman <wichert@wiggy.net>: Add configurable html to wifidog error messages. This has been a long-requested feature.

2008-04-13 Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>
	* contrib/build-openwrt-kamikazeipk/wifidog/Makefile:  Add iptables userspace dependencies
	* Release 1.1.5
	
2008-03-24 Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>
	* Integrate with OpenWRT kamikaze build system

2007-11-01 Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>
	* Apply portability patches by David Young <dyoung@pobox.com>.  These have been reviewed, but not tested.

2007-10-18 Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>
	* fw_iptables.c: From Philippe April:  reverted change made in 1241 so we properly remove the entry from mangle.WiFiDog_Incoming when kicking out users, it was affecting statistics 
	* Update doxygen.cfg.in for latest version and to fix path ambiguity during make dist.
	* Release 1.1.4

2007-07-06 Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>
	* Makefile.am:  Slight change in make ipk tagrget.  It seems that sometimes builddir isn't defined.  srcdir works just as well in this case.
	
2007-06-27 Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>
	* util.c:  Fix while loop initialisation bug
	* conf.h:  Forgot to change the value of NUM_EXT_INTERFACE_DETECT_RETRY to actually make it wait forever.

	* Centralise browser redirect code to simplify code
	* Add manual logout URL, based in part on work by David Bird
	* Release 1.1.3 final
	
2007-06-24 Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>
	* Close #321:  Make the Gateway retry forever if it cannot find it's interface.  You never know when someone may finally replug the network cable or something...
	* Close #332:  Apply patch from Laurent Marchal. biguphpc<AT>gmail<DOT>com
	* fw_iptables.c:  Fix error in iptables_fw_access().  Rules were created as ACCEPT instead of DROP
	* firewall.c:  Fix bug in fw_sync_with_authserver().  The traffic for the validation period of a user who validated his account while connected wouldn't get counted.
	* doc/wifidog_firewall_map.dia:  At long last, full documentation of the firewall.  We would have avoided a lot of stupid mistakes if we produced that sooner.
	* Release 1.1.3_rc1

2007-05-24 Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>
	* wdctl_thread.c:  Fix #324, again.  Credit goes to Medea, I misunderstood his instructons.
	* From David Bird <david@coova.com> libhttpd/: Fix #266 - don't process query string parameters and keep them in that request.path.

2007-05-18 Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>
	* wdctl_thread.c:  Fix #324
	
2007-04-26 Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>
	* wifidog.conf:  Improve comments and add examples of blocking access to the upstream LAN.

2007-04-26 Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>
	* conf.h:  The DEFAULT_CHECKINTERVAL was 5 instead of 60 (as stated in the config file) which caused huge needless load on the auth servers, and needless ping traffic towards the clients if it wasn't manually set.

2007-04-09 Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>
	* Makefile.am:  Slight path fix when using building make ipk.  Tell me if you have trouble with this

2007-01-06 Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>
	* contrib/ Add contrib dir to collect the scripts and other code distributed with, but not really part of wifidog.
	* Include the scripts used to build a ipkg on Openwrt RC6 and 0.9
	* Modify the build system to finally be able to build wifidog directly from the wifidog directory using the same files 
		used to make the official .ipk, without having to copy ANYTHNG to the openwrt SDK.
		At last, there is now a new target:  make ipk make ipk OPENWRTSDK=path_to_openwrt_sdk
	* ipk/ Removed the obsolete OpenWRT RC4 scripts
	* README.openwrt:  Update
	* scripts/openwrt/ remove obsolete dir.
	* contrib/dump_fw.sh:  Convenience script for firewall debugging.
		
2007-01-06 Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>
	* Documentation update in the code
	* Released 1.1.3_beta6

2006-10-26 Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>
	* src/conf.h: Fix #238 by using $sysconfdir to compute the default config-file location.
	
2006-10-08 Alexandre Carmel-Veilleux <acv@miniguru.ca>
	* Changed my email in a few files.
	* Broken down some printf's on multiple lines.
	* Added comments.

2006-09-14 Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>
	* src/util.c, src/conf.h: Fix autodectection of the External interface if not specified in the config file.  If the interface (typically pppoe) wasn't yet fully up when wifidog starts, wifidog would stop every connection from going trough.  It will now retry every second for up to two minutes, and then exit with a fatal error if it can't successfully detect it.

2006-02-23 Philippe April <philippe@ilesansfil.org>
	* src/fw_iptables.c:
	* Changed order in the filter.FORWARD chain
	* Added TCPMSS rule
	* Fixed deleting the rules on shutdown
	* Fixed wdctl reset problem
	* Released 1.1.3_beta4

2006-02-06 Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>
	* src/fw_iptables.c: Fix deleting the rules on shutdown.

2006-01-31 Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>
	* Release 1.1.3_beta2
	
2006-01-31 Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>
	* src/fw_iptables.c:  Add the global ruleset to the nat table to fix #65.
	Add the table parameter to iptables_load_ruleset() and iptables_compile
	* libhttpd/protocol.c:  Fix pointer type mismatch
    * src/conf.c,h:  Remove deprecated option AuthServMaxTries (which was already ignored anyway.	
	
2006-01-23 Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>
	* src/conf.h:  Fix the value of DEFAULT_AUTHSERVPATH and completely wrong code comment.  Not the default indicated in the config file and the define are in sync.

2006-01-17 Mina Naguib <mina@ilesansfil.org>
	* Ingisgnificant cleanup  of CVS artifacts after svn migration

2005-11-24 Philippe April <philippe@ilesansfil.org>
	* Bad idea

2005-11-01 Max Horvath <max.horvath@maxspot.de>
	* Added .project to .cvsignore

2005-11-01 Philippe April <philippe@ilesansfil.org>
	* Added OPTIONS section in wifidog-init (example: enable syslog)

2005-10-09 Philippe April <philippe@ilesansfil.org>
	* Changed html pages, added info to wdctl status

2005-10-07 Philippe April <philippe@ilesansfil.org>
	* Released 1.1.3_beta1

2005-10-03 Philippe April <philippe@ilesansfil.org>
	* libhttpd: Fixed two bugs parsing the GET query string making wifidog segfault

2005-09-24 Mina Naguib <mina@ilesansfil.org>
	* New wdctl command "restart" which will get wifidog to restart itself
	while preserving the existing clientlist.  Perfect for 0-downtime
	upgrading!
	* safe.c: New safe_fork that croaks if the fork fails, also takes care of
	closing some global file descriptors for the child
	* debug.c: Now also logs the PID as part of every entry
	* gateway.c: Handler for SIGCHLD now waitpid()s with WNOHANG flag to prevent deadlock
	when the handler is called and another wait() or waitpid() is used
	* util.c: execute() now uses waitpid() instead of wait() to reap only the child
	it fork/executed
	* Extra debugging entries throughout code

2005-09-24 Mina Naguib <mina@ilesansfil.org>
	* conf.c: Pre-emptive bugfix - harsh lockdown of parsing trusted MAC
	addresses from config file

2005-09-24 Philippe April <philippe@ilesansfil.org>
	* (finally) Added {Saul Albert,Jo Walsh,Schuyler}'s patch (thank you!) to send
	the GW interface's mac address as the node_id if no node_id is specified. It allows
	the use of generic configuration files without the need to hardcode the
	node_id in.
	* Added TrustedMACList configuration variable which allows specifying
	MAC addresses which are allowed to go through without authentication.
	* Updated OpenWrt instructions.

2005-09-08 Philippe April <philippe@ilesansfil.org>
	* Added compile instructions and installation for OpenWrt Whiterussian-rc2
	* Released 1.1.2

2005-05-30 Mina Naguib <mina@ilesansfil.org>
	* New wdctl command "restart" which will get wifidog to restart itself while preserving the existing clientlist.  Perfect for 0-downtime upgrading!
	* safe.c: New safe_fork that croaks if the fork fails, also takes care of closing some global file descriptors for the child
	* debug.c: Now also logs the PID as part of every entry
	* gateway.c: Handler for SIGCHLD now waitpid()s with WNOHANG flag to prevent deadlock when the handler is called and another wait() or waitpid() is used
	* util.c: execute() now uses waitpid() instead of wait() to reap only the child it fork/executed
	* Extra debugging entries throughout code
	
2005-05-24 Mina Naguib <mina@ilesansfil.org>
	* wdctl.c: Minor bugfix pointed out by David Vincelli: When an invalid
	command is given to wdctl, the error message showed "Invalid command:
	wdctl" instead of the actual command supplied

2005-05-23 Philippe April <philippe@ilesansfil.org>
	* Released 1.1.2_pre1

2005-05-23 Mina Naguib <mina@ilesansfil.org>
	* fw_uptables.c: When appending call to chain WiFiDog_Outgoing from
	nat.prerouting, add it via -A (at end) instead of -I 1 (at beginning) to
	allow for existing nat forwarding.

2005-05-16 Mina Naguib <mina@ilesansfil.org>
	* centralserver.c: read()s from central server in auth_server_request() are
	now timed-out (via select).  This is hopefully a bugfix to the
	thread-freezing problem.

2005-05-06 Mina Naguib <mina@ilesansfil.org>
	* Bugfix non-RFC compliant HTTP requests using \n instead of \r\n as line
	terminations as per email from ludocornut@users.sourceforge.net

2005-04-28 Philippe April <philippe@ilesansfil.org>
	* Released 1.1.2_beta2

2005-04-28 Mina Naguib <mina@ilesansfil.org>
	* wifidog.conf: Make the default ruleset for validating users = allow all
	(except sending SMTP)

2005-04-20 Philippe April <philippe@ilesansfil.org>
	* fw_iptables.c: Insert ourselves at the end of filter.FORWARD instead of
	at the beginning since important FW instructions are located there on the
	WRT54Gs when used with some DSL providers and we never execute them
	otherwise.
	* Released 1.1.2_beta1

2005-04-03 Philippe April <philippe@ilesansfil.org>
	* Fixed issue with FAQ
	* ipkg/rules: If autogen.sh doesn't exist, it's ok. 'configure' will.

2005-04-01 Philippe April <philippe@ilesansfil.org>
	* Duplicated auth server list in NAT table to fix the issue
	of using an auth server on port 80, since port 80 was being systematically
	redirected to 2060 otherwise.
	* Released 1.1.1

2005-03-29 Mina Naguib <mina@ilesansfil.org>
	* Added FAQ document copied from wiki

2005-03-22 Philippe April <philippe@ilesansfil.org>
	* Released 1.1.0

2005-03-20 Mina Naguib <mina@ilesansfil.org>
	* More verbose debugging output

2005-03-12 Mina Naguib <mina@ilesansfil.org>
	* More debugging output
	* Document ugly hack involving tid_fw_thread
	* SIGPIPE now ignored (as it's comment said) instead of being sent to the
	handler for SIGCHLD
	* Bugfix firewall destruction not happening from termination handler - had
	to move explicit thread kills after, not before, firewall destruction

2005-03-11 Mina Naguib <mina@ilesansfil.org>
	* If external interface was unspecified in the conf file, try to determine
	it from the default route
	* If external interface is known, specify it in the trigger rule in
	nat.PREROUTING to prevent the rule from matching traffic inbound to the
	router itself.  This should fix the issue raised by Philippe and Pascal on
	the mailing list
	* Bugfix: UNDO ABOVE 2 ITEMS. Aparently you cannot use the "-o" iptables
	option in nat.PREROUTING which makes knowing external_interface useless
	* Added new chain in nat.PREROUTING that explicitly allows all traffic to
	the router's internal IP from the internal interface, effectively
	addressing the same above problem

2005-03-07 Mina Naguib <mina@ilesansfil.org>
	* auth.c: Got rid of legacy _http_output and _http_redirect - replaced them
	with libhttpd functions and http_wifidog_header/http_wifidog_footer
	* auth.c: When re-directing to auth server now respects SSL setting instead
	of always http+port 80
	* auth.c: Better debugging output of what it's doing when it acts on auth
	server response
	* A little bit more care with buffers and their sizes
	* Minor whitespace tweaking and a couple of internal doc typo fixes

2005-03-06 Mina Naguib <mina@ilesansfil.org>
	* Check return values of pthread_create
	* Internal documentation touch-ups
	* auth.c: Bugfix invalid http header sent by _http_output
	* Bugfix traffic counter read from iptables as long int instead of long
	long int
	* Minor insignificant code touch-ups:
		* Replace pthread_mutex_lock/unlock calls with appropriate
		LOCK_FOO/UNLOCK_FOO macros for consistency
		* Lock first before using some variables, not after
		* Indentation adjustments

2005-03-04 Mina Naguib <mina@ilesansfil.org>
	* Bugfix huge uptime pointed out to be by Philippe - was caused when the
	date is set (with ntpclient for example) after wifidog starts
	* Beautified "Uh oh!" apology screens and redirection screen

2005-03-02 Alexandre Carmel-Veilleux <acv@acv.ca>
	* Ifdef'd out the bits that are Linux specific if __linux__ is not
	  defined.

2005-03-01 Mina Naguib <mina@ilesansfil.org>
	* Minor visual tweaks to the web interface

2005-03-01 Philippe April <philippe@ilesansfil.org>
	* Tagged v1_1_0_beta3

2005-02-28 Mina Naguib <mina@ilesansfil.org>
	* Do not update the last_updated field on incoming traffic - update it on
	outgoing traffic only.  This should be a much more reliable indication of
	client no longer being there
	* WifiDog status is now viewable with a web browser at
	http://ip:port/wifidog/status
	* Added new web hook for http://ip:port/wifidog
	* Beautified web interface at http://ip:port/wifidog/*

2005-02-24 Mina Naguib <mina@ilesansfil.org>
	* auth_server_request now returns AUTH_ERROR on error instead of AUTH_VALIDATION_FAILED
	* centralserver.c: Fix typo (was =+, made it +=) that made the response
	from the auth server corrupted in memory if the entire response would not
	fit in 1 packet and retrieved with 1 read() call
	* Better logging of details and calling of mark_* (auth+online/offline)

2005-02-22 Philippe April <philippe@ilesansfil.org>
	* Tagged v1_1_0_beta2

2005-02-20 Mina Naguib <mina@ilesansfil.org>
	* New safe.c with safe_malloc, safe_strdup, safe_asprintf and
	safe_vasprintf with propper logging and exit when error. Replaced all
	instances of original with safe versions in all files
	* Fix memory leak in iptables_fw_counters_update
	* Partial merge from CaptiveDNS branch: Consolidated much of the networking
	calls to the auth servers into a magical function called connect_auth_server()
	that's responsible for dns lookup, connecting, marking servers bad, marking
	online/auth_online, and refreshing the firewall rules.
	* Partial merge from CaptiveDNS branch: Added new functions mark_auth_online(),
	mark_auth_offline() and is_auth_online() - similar in nature to is_online()
	etc. except tailored to decide on auth servers status - currently being called by
	connect_auth_server()
	* Partial merge from CaptiveDNS branch: Different apology in 404 handler
	depending on whether internet is down or just auth server is down
	* Partial merge from CaptiveDNS branch: wdctl status now shows status of
	is_online and is_auth_online
	* Fixed several inconsistencies regarding the parity and size of
	incoming/outgoing counters.  Standardized on "unsigned long long int" in
	declarations and *printf/*scanf formats

2005-02-16 Philippe April <philippe@ilesansfil.org>
	* ipkg/rules - When we clean, forgot to delete ipkg-build-stamp

2005-02-15 Mina Naguib <mina@ilesansfil.org>
	* Now also reports wifidog_uptime when it pings the server, as well as
	shows it in wdctl status

2005-02-13 Mina Naguib <mina@ilesansfil.org>
	* Completely re-did the iptables rules.  Most of the rules are now in the
	filter table instead of the nat table.  Also DROPs are now replaced with
	REJECTs to help tell the user connection refused instead of endless pauses
	* Bugfix: Traffic from client to router was counted twice in the "outgoing"
	bytecount since it increased both counters in mangle.* and filter.* - Got
	rid of TABLE_WIFIDOG_WIFI_TO_GW completely since it's unneeded

2005-02-12 Mina Naguib <mina@ilesansfil.org>
	* Stricter format rules for all *scan* functions hunting for IPs and MAC addresses
	* fw_iptables.c: Make sure scanned IP address is a valid IP address
	* firewall.c: Fix memory leak in arp_get
	* libhttpd/protocol.c: Abort connection if read non-ascii from client. This
	is often a telltale sign of a program such as skype using port 80 for
	non-http requests - this therefore ends the thread as early as possible
	instead of having it lay around for a while trying to get a valid http
	request and taking up resources
	* ping_thread.c: When pinging auth server now also sends sys_uptime, sys_memfree
	and sys_load
	* -v commandline option now shows wifidog version

2005-02-11 Philippe April <philippe@ilesansfil.org>
	* Tagged v1_1_0_beta1

2005-02-11 Philippe April <philippe@ilesansfil.org>
	* Fixed a bug in counting the traffic between client and gateway
	* Alpha8

2005-02-04 Mina Naguib <mina@ilesansfil.org>
	* Partially bugfix apology when offline
	* ipkg/rules: More tweaking to make it build nicely with recent openwrt
	buildroots

2005-02-03 Mina Naguib <mina@ilesansfil.org>
	* Keep track of last times we successfully & unsuccessfully spoke to the
	auth server/used DNS. Then, if we know we're not online, show a little
	apology to the user instead of re-directing them to the auth server.
	* ipkg/rules: Added some extra version detection to auto-detect versions
	of kernel, iptables and ipkg-utils instead of having them hardcoded.  This
	makes creating ipkg's work with different OpenWRT releases
	* fw_iptables.c: Fixed memory leak caused by not freeing return from
	iptables_compile in iptables_load_ruleset
	* http.c: Deleted unused call to client_list_find
	* http.c: /about URL now shows wifidog version
	* Cosmetic typo fixes

2005-02-03 Philippe April <isf_lists@philippeapril.com>
	* Ping the users everytime we check their counters, that way we keep them
	alive
	* Optional ExternalInterface
	* Optional GatewayAddress (we discover it. finally.)
	* We check for the traffic from the clients to the firewall, to catch the
	traffic the icmp ping is generating
	* Fixed bug where we were doing the opposite of what desired when checking if authentication server was alive
	* Bumped to alpha7

2005-01-23 Philippe April <isf_lists@philippeapril.com>
	* wdctl status will return the auth servers in the linked list
	* We'll now forward to the auth server to display the used-to-be-ugly
	messages like "go ahead and validate your account you have 15 minutes"
	* Bumped to alpha6

2005-01-06 Philippe April <philippe@philippeapril.com>
	* fw_iptables.c: Changed REJECT to DROP for the end of the table Unknown,
	  REJECT doesn't seem to be available in the NAT table.
	* fw_iptables.c: Indented things
	* fw_iptables.c Fix: Created the authservers table at the beginning and destroy
	  at exit time only to avoid recreating it everytime
	* Bumped to alpha5

2005-01-05 Philippe April <philippe@philippeapril.com>
	* Typo, fixed some spaces (mostly esthetic)
	* Bumped to alpha4

2004-12-19 Alexandre Carmel-Veilleux <acv@acv.ca>
	* src/fw_iptables.c: Tweak of auth_server firewall rule setting
	  code. (and promptly undone, fixing the cause is better then
	  fixing the symptom)
	* src/conf.c: NULL-fill auth_server struct so that
	  auth_server->last_ip always equals NULL when first filled.

2004-12-16 Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>
	* src/fw_iptables.c: Display iptables command that is run in debug mode.
	
2004-12-07 Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>
	* src/firewall.c: Fix reversed incoming and outgoing connections in statistics code
	* bump version to alpha3

2004-11-29 Alexandre Carmel-Veilleux <acv@acv.ca>
	* wifidog.conf: Fixed firewall rule bug.
	* src/fw_iptables.c: Unknown user default block rule not "REJECT"
	  instead of "DROP"

2004-11-23 Alexandre Carmel-Veilleux <acv@acv.ca>
	* src/conf.c: Fixed a NULL pointer dereference in get_ruleset().

2004-11-22 Alexandre Carmel-Veilleux <acv@acv.ca>
	* libhttpd/api.c: Fix leak in HttpdEndRequest().
	* src/ping_thread.c: Fix auth_server IP change code with latest
	  from previous branch.
	* src/conf.h: Same as above.
	* src/fw_iptables.c: Same as above.
	* src/conf.[ch]: Firewall rule set parsing code.
	* wifidog.conf: Default firewall rule set defined.
	* src/fw_iptables.[ch]: Firewall rule set enacting code.
	* configure.in: bumped version to 1.1.0-alpha2

2004-11-18 Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>

	  move over to a worker thread system. http_callback_auth() no
	  longer spawns a thread either.

	used to set the User Class of the connection.
	* The UserClasses (global definitions) and Rights (per connection)
	have been integrated.

2004-03-10  Philippe April <papril777@yahoo.com>
	* Small fix to firewall.c so we don't define variables after
	the function has started (so it builds on gcc-2.95)

2004-03-09  Philippe April <papril777@yahoo.com>
	* Major changes, not forking anymore for new connections, now using
	select() instead. It will allow us to efficiently use a linked list to track

2004-03-08  Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>
	* Initial CVS import.  Integrate a standrad GNU build system and Doxygen to the build process.  Add Doxygen and CVS headers, .cvsignores, etc.  Note that the imported code is Philippe April (papril777 at yahoo.com)'s work.  Tell me if I forgot anything.  Please note that the paths in the src/fw* scripts are still hardcoded.  Don't forget to update the ChangeLog file every commit and add doxygen comments to your code.  Happy hacking.
