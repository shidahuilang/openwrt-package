define Package/atop/description
  Atop is an ASCII full-screen performance monitor for
  Linux that is capable of reporting the activity of all
  processes (even if processes have finished during the
  interval), daily logging of system and process activity
  for long-term analysis, highlighting overloaded system
  resources by using colors, etcetera. At regular
  intervals, it shows system-level activity related to the
  CPU, memory, swap, disks (including LVM) and network
  layers, and for every process (and thread) it shows e.g.
  the CPU utilization, memory growth, disk utilization,
  priority, username, state, and exit code. In combination
  with the optional kernel module netatop, it even shows
  network activity per process/thread.
